Our project is designed to automate the extraction of course information from a university's online course catalog. The main objective is to
provide users with a simple way to input a URL, scrape relevant course data from the webpage, and display this information in a structured format and
calcuating the cost of the course.
This is all to save the end user time and effort. This can be particularly useful for students, academic advisors, and educational 
researchers. This design ensures that each part of the process is handled by a distinct function, 
promoting modularity and making the code easier to maintain and extend. For instance,
if the structure of the course catalog webpage changes, only the functions responsible extracting the 
websites information needs to be changed (extract_courses), leaving the rest of the codebase unaffected.


To run the code from the command line, type in:
python webscraping.py AND/OR python regex_webscraper.py. Links to the website will be provided.
